Initial schematic and gerbers for a Gotek SFRC2D.B based on an Artery St32F415 chip.
Used photographs and a multimeter without removing any chips. Only removed RA/RB/RC to verify connections to U3.
Should work for the STM105 variant as some of the smoothing caps don't make sense for the Artery chip but do for the STM.
Added connections for a rotary encoder (J1) using U3 Pins 50 (PC10), 51 (PC11) and 37 (PC6) and replaced RB and RC with
a 2x2 RA pin header (J2).
